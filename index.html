                Programmable is a crypto intelligence company. We help savvy 
                investors to invest early in the most impactful innovation.

            <h2>Permissionless Investment</h2>
            <p>
                We build software systems that find signal amidst deafening noise. Early crypto investment 
                is unlike traditional VC investment. We do not have to ask protocol founders for their 
                order books or analytics data. We do not have to ask them for demonstrations, design
                documents, or code samples. This is because transactions are recorded on the blockchain, 
                and because protocols are open source. The challenge, of course, is to navigate this 
                unprecedented access and make sense of it all. This is our unfair advantage. We build software
                systems that measure, classify and predict the real-world impact of protocols in real time.

            <h2>Permissionless Innovation</h2>
            <p>
                We direct investment to protocols that unlock permissionless innovation. We are agnostic about the 
                view that programmable money will eat fiat currency. This is the Bitcoin maximalist position. 
                Instead, we believe that real disruption will come from making valuable assets openly programmable. 
                Our view is that this will start with borderless lending and (parametric) insurance. In time, we 
                believe that smart contracts will serve as community-driven APIs (open source and with the right
                financial incentives baked in), and these APIs will incrementally unbundle the Big-Tech monopolies.
